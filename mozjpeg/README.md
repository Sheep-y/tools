# Mozjpeg for Windows #

This is a wrapper for [Mozilla JPEG Encoder Project](https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg),
a high efficiency jpeg "compressor" that far surpress other common graphic tools.

Usage:

1. Save all files in a folder.
2. Drag and drop jpeg and png images onto the batch (.bat) file to compress them.

Compressed images will be saved in the same folder as the image (not the tool), without overwriting the original.
