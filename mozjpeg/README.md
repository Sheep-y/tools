# Mozjpeg for Windows #

This is a wrapper for [Mozilla JPEG Encoder Project](https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg),
a high efficiency jpeg "compressor" that far surpress other common graphic tools.

The wrapper is a simple batch (.bat) file.
Drag and drop jpeg and png images onto the file to compress them.
Compressed images will be saved in the same folder in a similiar name, without overwriting the original.
